      The final stage in the thought process is articulation, and I frequently have thoughts for which I have no suitable recipient. Rather than bothering my friends with these rambles, which are often more akin to delusional states brought on by caffeine than cohesive ideas, I have started this blog, so that they can forever stare back at me from cyberspace.

        With that said, some recent emissions:
        $for(posts)$
          <li>
            <div><a href=".$url$">$title$ - $date$</a></div>
          </li>
        $endfor$
      </div>

      This site uses a few technologies I like:
      Hakyll - Haskell mostly-static-content webserver
      Pandoc - for parsing the markdown
      hosted on a NixOS Digitalocean droplet for $$5 per month
