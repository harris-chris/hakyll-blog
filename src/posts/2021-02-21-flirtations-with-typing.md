One thing which I cannot stop thinking about - and, to the regret of both myself and those around me, talking about - is type systems. Colleagues have, I think, learned to avoid going even remotely near this topic, for fear of provoking unnecessarily-aggressively-worded opinions from me on this matter.

The bulk of my programming experience has been in Scala and Python, two languages that - I think it is fair to say - sit at opposite ends of the typing spectrum - Python could scarcely be looser and Scala could scarcely be tighter. I love and hate both in different ways. Right now I'm a strong typing man through and through. But that has changed in the past and could change again.

One distinction I think I should get out the way early is that within typed languages, there is the good and the bad, the new and the old. Java and C have type systems, but these are there to help the compiler, and not at all to help the programmer. 

IDE support
old typing systems like Java.
'latent'
Arina's comment about casting
fear that I have the zeal of the converted.
Array typing is actually a notorious topic
