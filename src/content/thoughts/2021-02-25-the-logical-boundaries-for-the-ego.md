National identification (I intend the phrase non-perjoratively) is big in Asia. People will identify with their own countries, and they will see you a little less as a free-roaming person and a little more as the product of wherever you happen to be from. It will be assumed that many of your personality traits can be directly traced back to the culture and history of your homeland, moreso than you might sometimes feel comfortable with. Taking this too far I think is unwise, and means you needlessly put yourself on the hook for the actions of those who (in any meaningful sense) you have nothing to do with. But it raises a larger question with no easy answer - where should you draw the boundaries of your ego?

The advantage of casting your ego-net wide is that you get to claim credit for stuff you didn't do. The disadvantage is that you have to feel embarassed for stuff you didn't do. Therefore you could simply regard this as a punt on whatever it is you're associating yourself with. For years I happily claimed credit, without really thinking about it, for being a British citizen - the UK being seen as a largely sensible and well-to-do place. With first Brexit and then Covid, these past few years this bet has not been such a good one.

So I think I need some kind of a principle here, rather than opportunistically claiming credit/dodging blame as best we can. One problem is that most responses to this question are going to sound rather arbitrary. If you're sticking with tradition and identifying with your family/culture/homeland then it's quite hard to draw sensible boundaries. How far should this extend? If you're English should you extend that to the UK? Should you then extend that to Europe? Different languages, sure, but to some extent the same shared culture and history.

The system I would propose here is that your ego shouldn't encompass anything that you haven't chosen or can't control. This means a lot of things that you'd normally identify with, you shouldn't identify with:
- your homeland
- your company
- your culture
- your family history
- your looks

This is not to say that people shouldn't have a positive view about these things, just that they should keep their ego in check when they're being praised, and needn't feel ashamed when they're under-performing. And if you have contributed significantly to any of them - say, if you've worked hard to keep your family from going off the rails - then certainly, feel proud of that. There is no doubt a time dimension to this as well - can you claim credit for the things you did a long time ago? Was the person who did those things, the person you are now? What about the guy who was a top athlete in his day but is now barely able to move off his sofa?

The goal here is not to wash your hands of a bad situation, nor to avoid the urge to improve it, but just to alleviate unnecessary suffering. Pulling back from these unnecessary ego over-reaches gives us more emotional and intellectual space to apply to other things. The damage for identifying with things beyond your control actually seems to go in both directions - some people are crushed with shame about something their family or some group they belong to did, but on the other side there are those racked with insecurity and guilt for being given credit for something they have not really earned - their looks or their talent.
