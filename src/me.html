          Currently based in Tokyo, Chris has spent most of his career in finance, working at asset management companies in London and Tokyo. In 2017 he and the asset management industry together decided that a break was in order, and he started an asset allocation software company, Petri. He is currently Chief Data Officer for Visual Alpha, a client reporting dashboard for asset management companies. He finds romance in slightly obscure tools and is a sometimes uncomfortably passionate advocate for typed functional programming languages.
          He has burned through a number of hobbies, not least amongst them rock climbing & mountaineering, Jiu Jitsu, windsurfing and boxing. He owns two Burmese cats and reads for an hour every evening in the bath.
